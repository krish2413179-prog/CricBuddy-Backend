# CricBuddy-Backend
I designed and architected a scalable backend for the cricket application using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Redis. My responsibilities included implementing secure user authentication with JWT, supporting both email/password and Google (OAuth2) sign-in. I also built the core protected API endpoints for managing user data, such as favorite teams, and integrated a third-party sports API with a Redis caching layer for performance. A key contribution was deploying a scikit-learn machine learning pipeline as an API endpoint to generate real-time match win probabilities. To deliver a live experience, I engineered a real-time data pipeline using WebSockets and Webhooks to process incoming match data, trigger ML predictions, and broadcast live scores to the client. Finally, I developed a scheduled background service using APScheduler to send personalized push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for upcoming matches.
